How to start:
start flask application with "flask run"
paste url of local server in browser (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000) -> start site of application opens

Important information:
The application uses the Api. The Api offers free API keys. However, the usage of the API is limited to 5 requests per second. For this reason, a Not Found site may sometimes be displayed when testing the application. In such a case just try again later.

Future work:
better search for stocks
more analysis options for stock data charts
